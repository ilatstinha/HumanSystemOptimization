However, finding a copy of the game can be difficult nowadays, as it is no longer sold in stores or online platforms. Fortunately, there are some websites that offer the game as abandonware, which means you can download it for free and play it on your PC. In this article, we will show you how to download TMNT 2003 PC game full version for free from some of these websites.
 
## Step 1: Choose a website to download the game
 
There are several websites that offer the TMNT 2003 PC game as abandonware, but not all of them are reliable or safe. Some of them may contain viruses, malware, or unwanted software that can harm your computer or compromise your privacy. Therefore, you should be careful and choose a reputable website to download the game.
 
One of the websites that we recommend is My Abandonware[^1^], which is a large archive of old games that are no longer supported by their developers or publishers. The website has a good reputation and provides detailed information about each game, such as screenshots, description, genre, platform, year, publisher, developer, etc. You can also read user reviews and ratings to see what other people think about the game.
 
Another website that we recommend is Abandonware Games[^2^], which is similar to My Abandonware but focuses more on action and fighting games. The website also has a lot of information about each game, such as genre, platform, year, developer, publisher, etc. You can also see user ratings and comments to get an idea of the quality of the game.
 
## Step 2: Download the game file
 
Once you have chosen a website to download the game from, you need to find the game file and download it to your computer. The game file may be in different formats depending on the website, such as ZIP, RAR, ISO, EXE, etc. You may need to use a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the file if it is compressed.
 
For example, if you choose to download the game from My Abandonware[^1^], you will see two options: RIP Version and ISO Version. The RIP Version is a smaller file that contains only the essential files to run the game. The ISO Version is a larger file that contains the full image of the original CD-ROM. You can choose either option depending on your preference and available space on your computer.
 
To download the file, simply click on the Download button and save it to your desired location on your computer. You may need to wait for a few minutes depending on your internet speed and the size of the file.
 
## Step 3: Install and run the game
 
After you have downloaded the game file, you need to install and run the game on your PC. The installation process may vary depending on the format of the file and the website you downloaded it from. Some files may come with an installer that will guide you through the installation steps. Some files may require you to mount them as virtual drives using a software like Daemon Tools or PowerISO. Some files may not need any installation at all and you can just run them directly.
 
For example, if you downloaded the RIP Version from My Abandonware[^1^], you will see a folder called TMNT after extracting it with WinRAR or 7-Zip. Inside this folder, you will see an executable file called TMNT.exe. To run the game, simply double-click on this file and enjoy!
